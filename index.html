							I have never met someone as caring, pretty, and smart as you. 
							Without you in my life I would not be the same person I am today. 
							You make me want to be a better person. 
							As a thank you for tolerating me for <strong>3 years</strong>, I made this Site. 
							I love you :)

							<p>OMG look at that smile!!! I think right after this picture we figured out that we could record video by holding down the picture button. The wall behind us is where we decided to take our photo for "Best Couple" in our yearbook </p>

							<h2>Our Little Sailing trip</h2>
							<p>My dad was so happy when we decided to go sailing with him. 
								I think we made it all the way out to the cargo ships in the middle of the bay. 
								You were super scared because you were afraid that my dad was going to ask you about boat stuff.
								Of course, that never happened...

							<h2>Zoo Date V2</h2>
							<p>The reason I took this photo was because we had taken the same photo back in our sophmore year of highschool. 
								I remembered that we just held hands and talked for 45 mins straight. 
								Since this was right in front of a baboon enclosure, the baboons would make a funny noise and we would both laugh.

							<h2>School Lunch</h2>
							<p>For some reason you let me try on your glasses even though they CLEARLY don't fit. 
								This is when you weren't 100% open with me so you purposfully tried to not fully smile. 
								It's ok though, I broke your shell eventually</p>

							<h2>Halloween</h2>
							<p>That day was so wierd. Since I had recently gotten into the show My Hero Academia, I decided to dress up as the main character from the show. 
								Instead as making or buying a full costume, I bought a cheap hoodie on amazon with the design of the main characters out fit printed onto it. 
								Since I was super embarrassed about how terrible the hoodie was, I brought a fake Minecraft pickaxe to school and said that I was a "light skin Steve"</p>

							<h2>Ice Rink</h2>
							<p>You have no idea how scared I was when we got to the ice rink. 
								I knew that your family was really good at ice skating and 90% of the time I was going to be left behind. 
								I was right for the most part, but it was fun being flung around by your family when we all held hands :)</p>
